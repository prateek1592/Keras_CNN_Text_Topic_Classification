# Keras Tutorial on usage of pre-trained embeddings in topic classification

Most code in this notebook is taken from the Keras tutorial page. The goal of this notebook was to understand, in depth,
the usage of CNNs in text classification - have never used these before in combination. The notebook has some notes,
pointers, learnings, and is largely for a self-learning purpose.
